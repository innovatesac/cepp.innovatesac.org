3d-led-cube-interactive,10,Christopher K. Biddle,Microgrant ($5k),Individual/Sole Proprietor,Light23 Company (light23.com),3D LED Cube Interactive,"Urban Tech, Temporary Activations, Public Art/Installations","$5,000.00 ","$5,000.00 ","Large, interactive, three-dimensional, multi-color LED cube display.","The core of this project would be a large, multi-color cubical lattice (the cube) composed of 4,096 LEDs. It would measure 30"" x 30"" x 30"". The cube could either hang from a ceiling joist, a truss system extending from the floor, or a similar structure. This would allow it to be seen overhead, ideally about seven or eight feet above ground, from all angles.The cube would operate in two modes, ""idle"" and ""game"". In ""idle"" mode, the cube would randomly display various 3D animation patterns and scrolling 3D lettering of sponsors and advertisers. A group of passersby, however, could place it into ""game"" mode through a button or hand swipe, and turn it into an interactive 3D pong, or similar game. With 3D pong, multiple users would each manipulate a paddle restricted to a face of the cube to intercept a ball moving within the cube. The cube would be re-programmable so more animations and games could be added over time following initial deployment.Since the cube is composed of LEDs, it would ideally be suited for an indoor venue with subdued lighting, or outdoors after sunset. If outdoors, the cube would need to be deployed in a weatherproof casing or other sheltering structure. One location recently suggested by a local major developer was one of the RT Light Rail stations. The cube could contribute to its revitalization effort by literally ""brightening"" it up. It would require AC power to operate, but the power requirements are not high, about 20 to 40 watts.LEDs are generally very durable and have a long life span, but scheduled monthly maintenance would be recommended. Maintenance would include cleaning and the replacement of any burnt out LEDs (The cube is composed of removable panels that allow access to every LED for replacement).I, Chris Biddle of Light23 Company, will be working in conjunction with Brandon Ortiz and Isela Perez of Obra Art and Technology Compound on this project, fulfilling the grant project's desire to encourage collaboration among community partners.",7/1/17,12/31/17,"The project would be located in an accessible public area. Light23 Company or its affiliates would periodically inspect and maintain the product to ensure a long life span. Its success would be measured by its longevity, the level of interactive engagement by the public, and the effectiveness of the displayed advertising.","A direct economic benefit of the cube is that of serving as a three dimensional advertising signboard for various organizations, both public and private. Another economic benefit is the attraction such a piece would have to the public within the area where the cube is deployed. It could serve as a beacon drawing people to its location, benefiting nearby store owners and vendors.","The cube has the obvious benefit of demonstrating a correlation between art and technology. The interactivity would be facilitated through a combination of IoT, wifi direct, and/or bluetooth, thereby serving as a pinnacle representation of how such cutting edge communication protocols and LED technology can be implemented in artwork. Much of the technology used would be open sourced, inspiring the youth who will recognize that the technology involved is within their grasp."
toposhare,13,Kimberly Garza,Microgrant ($5k),Individual/Sole Proprietor,ATLAS Lab Inc.,TOPOshare,"Public Art/Installations, Temporary Activations, Youth/Education, Cultural Equity, Underserved Communities","$5,000.00 ","$16,120.00 ",TOPOshare is a temporary art installation that seeks to improve public life on Broadway and serve as community outreach tool for nonprofits,"WHYSacramento is a city in transition, having rebounded from the recent recession to become one of the most desired housing markets in the country in the span of five years. The completion of the Golden 1 Center, the forthcoming Railyards and Mill development, and many others highlight a strengthening urban core, and this spread of revitalization is moving past the Business 80 and Highway 99 arteries into the surrounding metropolitan area. The burgeoning corridor, Broadway is home to a variety of businesses, neighborhoods, local government and industry, but it lacks thoughtful art and recreational opportunities. The Broadway corridor is in a unique position to improve the street level experience by activating various vacant and underutilized parcels that dot the landscape. TOPOshare, a temporary art installation, responds to this opportunity by activating multiple sites on Broadway to form a constellation of imaginative, safe, and youth-focused activity nodes.WHATTOPOshare is comprised of a series of colorful milk crates, once assembled and configured, to create a topographic surface for the community to interact, discover and play.  The goal is to activate a series of vacant/underutilized sites along the Broadway corridor over a one-month period (from 16th Street to MLK) testing the opportunity for youth focused recreational and art opportunities.HOWBroadway serves as a connection point for the residential areas to the South and the downtown area to the North. To further embody a shared sense community, TOPOshare will partner with the many local nonprofit organizations (e.g. Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services, Next Move, City Year Sacramento) in the Broadway area by using the same milk crates used to create the installation to collect donation goods through food drive activations pre and post installation.",4/1/18,5/1/18,"The project is geared towards improving public life and community involvement on Broadway. One way of gauging project success is through monitoring foot traffic on site. Activation events will be key in providing insight on what sites are most used and popular. This information will be helpful in determining future placement for a permanent installation.  With regards to giving back to the community, a measure of success will be successful raising of goods for the local nonprofits partners (e.g. Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services, Next Move, City Year Sacramento) as well as increased public awareness of these partners.","By enlivening the corridor with pedestrian and youth focused activities, TOPOshares goal is to get feet on the street and increase awareness of Broadways current businesses. Moreover, at the activation events, partnerships with local businesses will be key to bringing visibility to the project while simultaneously showcasing businesses in the Broadway area. ","The project aims to specifically serve adjacent nonprofits (e.g. Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services, Next Move, City Year Sacramento) and youth in the area through soliciting donations for nonprofits and using installation as an outreach tool. For example, the installation milk crates would subsequently be used to collect, store, and distribute goods on behalf of the Sacramento Food Bank."

We'll interview poets for live audiences, then share videos online","Coffee and Poets is an expansion and relocation of a successful 5-year-old artistic project which features local writers interviewing other writers. Curator and local spoken word artist Lawrence Dinkins, Jr., known by his pen name NSAA, has hosted this live show at Naked Lounge on H Street since 2012, but he plans to move the event to Broadway Coffee in Oak Park. This live monthly show at will enliven that locally owned coffee house.  Dinkins also plans to produce professional videos of the interviews and share them online. With more online content, the series will find a wider audience and bring more attendees to the events.All the funds requested are for video equipment - Dinkins needs $3000 for a video camera and $1700 for a laptop that will serve as a video mixer. He will use these to create top quality videos of local writers speaking in the Coffee and Poets series.Dinkins has worked on many community projects before - he is a regular monthly poetry host for three different poetry meetups in Sacramento: Joe Montoya's Poetry Unplugged at Luna's Cafe, Mahogany Urban Poets at Queen Sheba's Ethiopian Restaurant, and the Third Thursday poetry series organized by the Sacramento Poetry Center for the Central Library. Dinkins also does volunteer work for the Brickhouse Gallery in Oak Park, and he has worked with Sacramento Area Youth Slam (SAYS), and many other local organizations.Since 2012, Dinkins curated the Coffee and Poets series at Naked Lounge until that venue recently announced it was closing. In that 5-year span, Coffee and Poets featured spoken word artists such as Straight Out Scribes, Sean King, and ""Trouble,"" plus local poets laureate, including Bob Stanley, Indigo Moor, Allegra Silberstein, and Andy Jones. The series brings poets of all styles and ethnicities to the interviews, and has been an important part of the local literary scene since its inception.Adding a video component to the program (instead of audio) will greatly expand the reach of the series, and should help make people aware of the diversity of poets and writers here in Sacramento. The owner of Broadway Coffee is one of the founders of the Sacramento Black Book Fair, and he is a leader in the Oak Park community. Lawrence Dinkins is excited to bring this program to Oak Park and to help make Broadway Coffee a literary hub.",9/20/17,,"Mr Dinkins is in touch with his audiences, and for Coffee and Poets there would be three measures of success. Are audiences growing at the live events? Is the online audience growing and sharing with others? And is the management of Broadway Coffee happy with the turnout at the events? A secondary success would be if Oak Park residents start to come out in numbers. Mr. Dinkins, who is African-American, will also be networking with his colleagues at the Brickhouse Gallery, which is nearby. So these events could also provide cross-promotion for Brickhouse and other Oak Park establishments.","Assisting Broadway Coffee to bring in customers is the primary goal on the economic side. But if we make Oak Park a literary hub, then Underground Books, Brickhouse Gallery, and Old Soul Coffee down the street could start to have more readings and events. The spread of the online videos should help as well.","Social impact has been a focus of Lawrence Dinkins' work for many years. His events welcome youth and underserved communities. At his annual ""Poet vs. Band"" event, there is always an engaged and diverse audience young, old, black, brown, and white. He makes readers, speakers, and audiences feel welcome, and so his programs, including Coffee and Poets, are well-attended. Bringing this program to Oak Park addresses cultural equity by bringing poetry to a part of town that hasn't had a regular poetry series for a number of years.  "
haiku-for-everyone,20,Lisa Ann Markuson,Microgrant ($5k),Business,The Haiku Guys and Gals,Haiku for Everyone,"Public Art/Installations, Performing Arts/Music, Pop-ups, Temporary Activations, Cultural Equity, Underserved Communities, Youth/Education","$5,000.00 ","$5,000.00 ","We will bring short, inspiring custom poetry to community centers & overlooked areas throughout Sacramento. We'll write haiku for everyone.","We make poetry accessible and egalitarian, while making every single haiku recipient feel like a VIP. Everyone is inspired and enchanted by vintage typewriters and dapper poets, talking to them about what is meaningful to them, then whipping up a 17-syllable poetic gift right before their eyes.This is performance art, a free pop-up store, public art, and can even be an educational experience because we often teach workshops showing students how to write their own haiku, learning about the history of the typewriter and the poetic form in the process. It applies to cultural equity because we ourselves are a multicultural company and people of all races and cultures worldwide love haiku. And, we are experienced and eager to bring haiku to underserved communities. Literally nobody regrets getting a free haiku - it is a gift that can brighten any day and even change a life.We are a highly experienced company of poets. Our minimalist setup is environmentally sensitive and very mobile, so we can travel through the whole city. We'd be interested in teaming up with a local artisan or carpenter to build a small mobile stage with us, and we'd like to work with the city to pinpoint the best public spaces in which to appear. The beauty of our work is that we can bring life to an abandoned building, the steps of the Capitol, a strip mall parking lot, a city park, or a First Friday art walk.This undertaking is particularly exciting to me, Lisa Ann Markuson, one of the co-founders and co-owners of our company, because I lived the first 18 years of my life in Sacramento. Coming back to Sactown has been a dream of mine for years and this is the perfect way to do it: giving back to the city that made me.I selected the microgrant because 5k can definitely fund a beautiful haiku pop-up. But, if you are open to discussing larger scale projects with more economic impact and multimedia components, I would love to give you more ideas about how we could put 25k to use in Sacramento.",9/15/17,,"Success for us is inspiration and joy for haiku recipients, and bringing poetry to a life that might not have had it otherwise. For the sake of this grant, it would make sense to have a goal to write and document at least 1,000 poems for 1,000 different people.","Often when we are brought to perform for corporate entities, they hire us because we draw crowds and help improve the connection between the host of a venue or event and the attendee. Any venue that hosts us benefits from the good energy and crowds we attract, and we can bring attention to areas that can use a boost.","We are 100% egalitarian, but maybe that is radical in its own way because, unfortunately, underserved populations are less likely to enjoy these type of culturally enriching activities. For a person to receive the same special care and attention from our artists, no matter their age, race, gender, orientation, or status: that is a huge social impact."

We are hoping to expand this project into an annual festival that will focus on using public spaces- specifically non profits to host music and art shows as well as a two day music festival.We believe that by collaborating with non profits who are already doing charitable work we are creating ""neutral grounds"" where underserved communities have enough history of the location to feel included  to participate in arts and music held at the same site. We also focus on creating events that have the ability to allow absolutely anyone to attend by offering a diverse staff that understands the implications that come with being a minority. We do everything in our power to create affordable events that are also all accessible to anyone with any kind of disability.We will also give each non profit that we work with an opportunity to reach a larger demographic of a music and arts community that would not have been aware of the services offered without Peach House Presents.By creating this kind of festival and collaborative we will be able to include small businesses, singular artists, musicians, non profits, farm to fork food vendors and other local businesses. Not only will we be employing numerous local businesses and bringing in their already existing customers but with a well funded festival we will be able to hire more renowned musicians and create a nationally recognized 2 day festival.With such a festival it will be inevitable for festival goers to avoid spending time and money on their overnight stay here on things such as hotel stays, local dining, and other amenities that Sacramento has to offer.Currently Daydream festival has been a DIY festival being hosted at Latino Center of Art and Culture and has been incredibly successful in our approach of creating a community of supportive artists.We believe that creating a supportive community that thrives on all inclusiveness will empower upcoming and younger artists to further expand Sacramento's music and art scene.Daydream Festival has gained incredible support from the existing community here and we wish to get enough funding to create a state and even nationwide community of supportive creatives. The current proposal will be adjusted to a micro grant and will focus on promoting local artists rather than national artists.",9/16/17,9/1/18,"Our goals for Daydream Festival and Peach house presents are to create art and music that is accessible to absolutely anyone regardless of race,gender,orientation, or any other factor as well as giving back to our community by creating an entire festival that hires and supports local businesses.Due to our goals, I will know that Daydream festival is successful when we see our underserved and invalidated communities interested in attending art/music events and supporting local businesses.","Daydream Festival's economic impact will be vast. By employing local artists, musicians, and local business vendors we will be able to offer job opportunities for a creative and business community that needs more financial support. Not only will we have a direct effect on employment of artists and businesses but we will be able to bring county wide festival goers through this event with the hopes to expand to a state and nationwide festival eventually.","Daydream festival's social impact will to be create supporters of art,music, and local business from underserved communities that have felt underrepresented and invalidated in the art scene due to race, economic status, gender, orientation or any other factor.By making an all accessible and affordable festival and art community we will be able to not only reach those underserved communities but also connect musicians,artists, and businesses with local charitable organization. Through this connection we believe that we will create an entire movement in Sacramento of organization, businesses, and artists willing and happy to work together."
art-advice-booth,42,Gioia Fonda,Microgrant ($5k),"Individual/Sole Proprietor, Other (I am representing a small group of artist ( about 10-15 people).

We are friendly, approachable, wise and earnest.","In the Spring 2016 a panel was held by California Groundbreakers at Beatnik Studios. This was a well-attended event that shed a spotlight on the needs, concerns, aspirations and grievances of the Sacramento art scene. The community expressed a lot of frustration about how to best to support artists/art spaces, how to fund art, how to allocate funds fairly, how to foster an equitable art community and what creates a healthy art scene.After this meeting several art community leaders met to further discuss the topics that came up. As artists and educators, we kept seeing the solutions circling back around to dispersing information and breaking down perceived barriers. Apparently, even in Sacramento, the art world can be intimidating and confusing. There are, of course, plenty of books and websites for artists about professional, technical and inspirational matters, but advice found in books or online isn't always specific enough to be of any use, or can sometimes be too advanced for the person making the inquiry or possibly is just inappropriate given where a person is in their growth as an artist. There is also so much out there, it can be overwhelming.Our answer to all of this was to create the Art Advice booth fashioned after Lucy's Psychiatric Advice booth in the Peanut's comic strip. We copied it right down to the 5 cent donation can. It is immediately recognizable, makes people smile and gets them curious enough to approach.Our aim is to create a forum for members of the public to ask any art related question without feeling ignorant or intimidated. We want to demystify the art world and prepare burgeoning artists to go after their dreams with a sense of purpose and plan of action. We encourage greater public art engagement and collecting. Combined, we have decades of higher education and professional experience between us, so we feel we are qualified to answer questions on a wide variety of topics, which is good since the questions we field range from the esoteric ""How do I know if I'm an artist?"" to the specific ""How can I get paint to stick to metal?"". For frequently asked questions, we've created an accordion folder full of take-away informational handouts.So far this has just been a volunteer labor of love, funded on our own (about $500 so far), but with a grant we could have much greater impact.  ",10/1/17,10/1/18,"We know our project is successful because of the meaningful connections we make with artists at our table. Sometimes participants follow-up through email or social media with further questions or reports of success. Our impact is difficult to track but our hope is that we can assuage some of the confusion and generate interest in art, help empower artists to conduct themselves in a more professional manner and generally inform, inspire and offer encouragement from one artistic soul to another. Our shared experiences and the type of mentorship we offer is valuable. Human connection is what makes this really work.","The Art Advice is more about economic empowerment than impact. For instance we regularly advise artists on pricing their artwork, understanding gallery commissions, brainstorming various platforms for selling their work, funding their educations and helping them budget their time, materials and limited resources. We are steadfast in our belief that there is no one ""right way"" to pursue art and encourage both academic and non-academic pathways to being an artist. Having seasoned artists walk less-experienced artists through some of these realities can prevent being taken advantage of or feeling discouraged or intimidated down the line.","As artists who have pursued formal art educations, we recognize both our privilege and the systemic barriers that still exist, thusly delaying our art community from being a true representation of the diversity of our region. This project is all about radical inclusivity. We advise whomever sits down at our booth, from a curious child, to the awkward amateur, to the professional dealing with a creative block. Everybody is welcome at the Art Advice booth. We even advise non-artists in matters of how to support (whether collecting or just understanding) the art and/or artists in their communities. "

The program brought young people and senior citizens together with aspiring teachers in the University's teacher training courses to learn to integrate the arts with education. Barrio Art includes several areas: the Children's Component (grades K-6); the Anciano Component (serving adults and the elderly); and the Cultural Component with the Danza Azteca. Although CSUS is no longer affiliated, the WNC continues to operate the program 40 years strong!  Barrio Art includes: Native Dance, Graffiti, fiber art, upcycled art, traditional cooking class, Dia De los Muertos, etc.  The Creative Economies would support a regular monthly Barrio Art Program. The funding would provide a stipend to artist who will lead a Barrio Art workshop monthly at the WNC. Each month there will be a themed art activity opened to the public-where the themes will range from cultural crafts and the medium would very from acrylic painting to sculpting. The artist would be community art teachers and or aspiring art teachers already taking courses at the community college or university level.  The funding would also provide the material for the workshops on a monthly basis. Workshops are meant to encompass all levels of creativity and encourage all age groups to work together. There could also be overlaying STEAM projects that would provide a more cultural lens to preserve the culture of our communities. The Barrio Art Workshops will also coincide with our quarterly Barrio Market where the art instructor will be provided a space to showcase their art work to a public audience. This would also give students an opportunity to display and or sell their creations. Additionally some of the funding would be utilize to market and advertise the Barrio Art workshops. This would encourage the public participate and knowledge of the program.

",The impact is great where we are providing a creative outlet for the community to participate in art workshops that some participants may not have had the opportunity. The workshops are free to the public. The impact is also great for the artists and potential art teachers. It will provide exposure and experience for their resumes. The show casing of work at the Barrio Market also adds to the quarterly pop up shops where additional audience would be able to support the local artist and makers.  ,The social impact is also great. Because the program is geared towards providing an artist and or art teach to the community it opens up the doors for the public and surrounding Downtown Sacramento community to participate. The themed Barrio Art workshops will have a cultural lenses.  The surrounding community has been designated as an undeserved community and we are already providing a space for cultural creation and preservation. In addressing cultural equity the themed workshops would meet these goals by ensuring teachers are based in the community and can provide a cultural aspect to the workshops.

","In 2016 the Oak Park Business Association (OPBA) partnered with a very dedicated group of volunteers to organize a tremendously successful month-long event to celebrate the Mexican holiday of Dia de los Muertos (remembrance of deceased family and friends, and celebration of life for the living).The series of events included lectures, workshops, cultural seminars, social events, parades and traditional celebrations.  On November 2nd the month long celebration culminates with a street festival on 36th Street in Oak Park, hosted by the Brickhouse Art Gallery.In addition to the support of the OPBA, dozens of businesses in the community have contributed time and resources to make this event a success.  Portions of our grant request are dedicated to expand outreach to businesses in the district, fostering additional support and participation.Historically it has been a challenge for the OPBA to sponsor community events.  Governed by a Management District Plan, approved by property owners in the district, a majority of our funds are appropriated to manage safety, security and maintenance programs, with few resources left over to support the dozens of events in the community.  The awarding of a Creative Economy Mini-Grant will increase the contribution to this incredible volunteer effort.  In partnership and collaboration, and with the additional funds, our team can expand our outreach and build the overall capacity.With that in mind, an important component of this request is the outreach work to be facilitated by the updating of an event website and the expanded marketing effort through social media outlets.  With limited funds, the organizing committee has relied on volunteers to address this need.  The OPBA will work with the volunteer leaders to design tools that can be maintained and updated in the future by future organizers.  Further, as we have learned first hand, there is an ongoing need for video and photographic images to solicit additional support, share details, advertise the event, and most importantly, create a historical and cultural archive.Thank you for considering our request.  These funds will make a significant impact on this endeavor and will allow us to expand our reach into the community.  Please note: additional information (event details, etc.) is included in the Dia de los Muertos (CBO) application for grant funding.",10/2/17,11/10/17,"One measurement of success will be the increased participation of businesses in Oak Park (and businesses from surrounding areas).  We will monitor this closely, and will actively engage dozens of businesses.  In addition, general attendance estimates for each event will provide measures of success.  We anticipate that attendance will increase significantly this year, with many thousands of participants expected.  Although many of the attendees will be familiar with the Broadway corridor and Oak Park, many will not.  This is a great opportunity to bring new community members into our neighborhood.","Although it is difficult to calculate the potential impact, simple estimates (from increased restaurant and retail sales) are in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Because there are many events during the month, in particular functions being planned on traditionally ""slow"" days for sales, we expect increases throughout the entire month.   Events on non-peak days are very important to our merchants and establishments.  Further, we believe that many of the economic gains will be long term, with the introduction, or re-introduction, of patrons with many of the businesses, new and old, in the district.","Oak Park has a tradition of hosting community events celebrating many cultures and we are proud to call Oak Park home to this amazing cultural event.  Although traditionally a Latino holiday, Dia de los Meurtos will be celebrated by many community members, regardless of their ethnicity, race, religion or background.   Further, community members in adjacent neighborhoods (Franklin, etc). will attend to participate in the events.  Although not the only Latino cultural event in Sacramento, this is one of just a handful.  The organizing committee has reported that the Latino population in Oak Park is 36-38%.   "

The majority of our work supports Natomas Charter School and we are excited to bring the experience so many NCS students have with exposure to the arts to the greater community.To that end, NAEF wants to bring a large scale musical with a cast of children, ages 10-18, to the Benvenuti Performing Arts Center stage. Our Youth Theatre for All projects will provide a valuable professional opportunity for young performers without charging a performance fee or requiring  anything more than a commitment of time and dedication to the production.Throughout the Sacramento region, children interested in performing are generally required to pay, often several hundred dollars, to participate in a show. In addition, there is often a minimum number of tickets each child is required to sell. The result is that many kids are left out of the opportunity to perform in a show because of the huge financial burden.NAEF plans to hire local professionals in their fields to direct, musical direct, choreograph, etc. providing jobs for professional artists in the area who will contribute their expertise to enhance the experience for the young performers and the show as a whole.At this time we are considering several shows, but we will likely produce Bye, Bye Birdie. The show's cast consists of nine main characters, 11 featured roles, and over 30 in the ensemble, providing performance opportunities to over 50 kids in the Sacramento region.In addition to an enriching experience for cast members, there will also be opportunity for kids who may not be inclined to perform, to be a part of the crew. Positions involving props, costumes, and backstage support will be available to interested youth.After a 4-5 week rehearsal schedule, two shows will be performed at the Benvenuti Performing Arts Center, offering the community a fun, family friendly show with reasonably priced tickets for everyone to enjoy.A community rich in theatre is a community full of artistic passion. NAEF hopes to provide a valuable shared experience for both the audience and performers.",6/11/18,7/21/18,"A five week rehearsal process with, the cast and crew working with professional artists, leading to a show for the entire community to enjoy.","Anytime an event like this is created it drives business to local restaurants as audiences often ""make a night of it."" In addition, this project will offer several jobs for professional theatrical artists as well as rentals from other theaters for costumes, props, and special set pieces. ","Natomas Youth Theatre for All will target youth as the cast will be entirely made up of kids ages 10-18. Underserved communities will clearly benefit due to the lack of payment required from those cast in the show. NAEF is committed to non-traditional casting based solely on talent and interest, ensuring cultural equity. Overall this project will bring our community together, supporting and enjoying great theatre and providing an artistically enriching experience for so many kids who may not otherwise have this opportunity."

Redirecting audiences into new spaces, new businesses and new neighborhoods. ","Sofar Sounds is a global, grassroots network of artists, hosts, and guests, all with the goal of helping to bring the magic back to live music. We curate secret, intimate gigs in unique spaces, from living rooms and churches to hoodie shops and fancy furniture showrooms. We aim to create performance spaces that are respectful to artists, where the audience lives in the moment and listens closely to the music. A Sofar show will typically feature three acts with no opener and no headliner. Every lineup is carefully curated to give the audience a diverse show, and each performer is given equal attention.Guests arrive on time for the first act and stay for the entire show. During the music, there is full attention: no talking or texting. You get up close and personal with the artists! Theres no backstage here, so chat with them, get to know them, and even get a drink with them after.Sometimes, we get big-name acts such as Grammy Award Winning Artist, Ed Sheeran drop in to perform, but most musicians are unknown up-and-comers from Sacramento and the surrounding areas. This means audiences are sure to hear something completely new  and new musicians are guaranteed a room full of attentive listeners.  We are also activating spaces/ business through our curated experiences bringing in 50 to 150 people into their space. For business it is built in advertising which is priceless in a time when face to face human interaction is a rarity. We are already activating businesses , places and spaces throughout the city on a monthly basis . Project Activate Sacs goal is to activate Districts and areas of the city we love who might not get as much activation. Sofar Sounds Sacramentos project  Activation Sacramento will focus on a specific district working with its Pbids and Council members for a 12 month time period activating a new location within that district each month with our unique pop up live music  experiences.",11/1/17,," Activation SAC will be successful through its power of connection. Connecting the global music built into the current Sofar Sounds global network with local business and community organizations, Sofar Sounds Sacramento has the ability to create opportunities for local artists to grow globally, local businesses to build their branding and marketing with 50-150 people who attend each event, and attract a global community to Sacramento for business and recreation. At each event, we will attract 50-150 people, connecting community with Sacramento businesses and community organizations. We will track the amount of people at each event."," When people want to spend an evening out, they are usually willing to travel to the neighborhoods that have the largest percentage of businesses that will cater to their needs i.e restaurants, music venues etc. Creating spaces like these in any neighborhood , Sofar Sounds is able to re-direct an audience of people looking for entertainment into new spaces, new businesses and new neighborhoods.  Sofar Sounds has a scalable model and could move from doing 2 shows a month to 25 shows, which would employ a significant number of Sacramento residents  to support those events."," The projects global-local connection is evident, and should not be understated. One area that were intentional about excelling in Sacramento is sharing our regions artistic diversity. Were committed to putting together diverse lineups that reflect our diverse Sacramento community, and throwing our events in neighborhoods that dont typically have access to arts institutions and funding. We are dedicated to give opportunities to the youth in Sacramento through internships and freelance work. We have had our team of young photographers of color published in local news articles.

We already reach and engage with thousands of readers every issue, but we need help to grow and reach NEW readers in MORE parts of the city.If awarded a micro-grant, we will use the money to purchase approximately 15 to 20 brand new outdoor news boxes that we will then put out in strategic locations around the city: neighborhood hot spots, near venues, coffee shops and eateries, as well as bus stops, light rail stops, etc. Some areas we want to target and expand our magazine distribution into include: Oak Park, South Sacramento, Del Paso, Natomas, and a number of Downtown and Midtown neighborhoods where we currently do not have news stands or news boxes placed.Submerge regularly publishes articles and write-ups on both national artists/musicians/etc that are touring through our region, as well as local artists/musicians/etc that are making waves in the regional scene and need outlets like ours to tell their stories. Every article we run plugs the subject's show or performance in the Sacramento-area, thus driving traffic to local venues, galleries and more.If we can get more news boxes regularly stocked with copies of Submerge into new areas of the city, we can actively reach new readers with our arts and entertainment coverage, which will encourage them to attend more concerts, art exhibits, try new restaurants, check out new events and more.In addition to all of that, expanding our magazine's distribution into new areas of the city also greatly benefits our many local contributors (writers and photographers that we hire) because it will get them and their work more exposure. We hire both experienced journalists and photographers, as well as young, up-and-coming contributors that need an outlet like ours to hone their craft.Also, if we can reach new readers in new areas of the city, we can potentially find new artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, etc. that we can eventually feature in the pages of Submerge. The more people that are aware of the important arts coverage we do, the better it is for the city as a whole. ",11/1/17,6/1/18,"We constantly track how many magazines are being picked up from every one of our distribution locations. If awarded a grant, the new news boxes that we will put out around the city will also be carefully tracked, watched over and taken care of. If for some reason a certain new distribution location was not performing up to our standards, we could always move said news box to a different location and then track its performance. We handle the distribution of our publication in-house, so we are very hands-on with every aspect of our magazine's creation and distribution. ","When people read Submerge and learn about upcoming events, performances, etc., they then go spend money locally to buy tickets, attend events, purchase merchandise from artists, etc. Every article we run has some sort of local tie-in that encourages readers to attend local venues, art galleries, and to actively engage with Sacramento's creative culture. We also work with dozens of local businesses, brands and event promoters on advertisements in our paper, so the more eyes that see their ads in new areas of the city, the more business they get. ","The arts and entertainment content that Submerge regularly puts out is literally for anyone and everyone of all ages who are interested in Sacramento's creative offerings. We cover ALL genres of music (from country to hip-hop, rock to jazz), MANY styles of art (from street art to fine art, photography to sculpture), and we also write about restaurants (from high-end, farm-to-fork eateries to local hole-in-the-wall joints) as well as upcoming events, festivals and fun things happening around town that we think our readers should know about.

The Read-ins are held and sponsored by public and private schools (primarily, but not exclusively preschool - 8), community centers, book stores, book clubs, and other venues throughout the city, such as  faith-based settings.The Book Fair itself takes place in the heart of Oak Park, and is centered around six venues: The Guild Theater, The Brick house Gallery, the Women's Civic and Improvement Club, Underground Books, the Alpha Kappa Alpha House, and one closed block of 36th St.  All events, including the read-ins mentioned above, are free and open to the public.  The Book Fair begins with a reception at Underground Books, followed by an evening program in The Guild Theater.  There is a follow-up reception at the Brick House Art Gallery.  The evening program highlights featured writers.  They constitute a panel which discusses important themes for Black literature.  For example, the theme for panelists during the 4th Book Fair was centered around each author's consideration of the meaning of ""Black Books Matter"".  The panelists' opening remarks are followed by an hour of spirited exchanges between the authors and those in attendance.  For the 5th Fair, authors will address the significance of the legacies of Black Books for authors and  writers.  The purpose of this specific application is to fund the participation of major national and/or international Black writers.The featured writers are not the only writers in attendance.  Local authors, authors from throughout Northern California, the entire state, the country, and  abroad, attend.  In the past the number of participating authors has ranged from 70 - 120.  For the Fifth Fair, we intend to reduce the number to 60 or below, because we have discovered that by reducing the number of authors we increase the exchange  between writers and the public.  Throughout Saturday (9 AM - 7 PM), things  start off with a walk around the neighborhood (The Book Parade), featuring local high school bands, followed by chats with authors in various venues, each lasting 75 minutes, including lectures  at the Guild.  The block of 36th Street is closed for live music and a wide range of cultural vendors.  There are related art displays in the venues.

Each month patrons enjoy strolling through open artist studios, some of which also serve as home for the residents at the Warehouse Artist Lofts (WAL). A diversity of art is displayed and for sale; but unfortunately, connecting with paying customers is in short supply and artists are not achieving a sustainable economic return on their investment of time and resources. As a 501 (C) 3 non-profit agency dedicated to building resilient communities, LIfeSTEPS would like to provide First Friday artists the opportunity to gain the skills they need to grow successful creative businesses.LifeSTEPS provides supportive services to over 300 low income housing properties throughout California, one of which is the WAL on R Street. A recent needs survey of WAL residents revealed over 75% would like to gain marketing skills to help them grow their creative businesses into a source of sustainable income. Today's artists undertand they need more than talent to be successful in a competative marketplace.To support creative business growth  LifeSTEPS is proposing a series of six workshops developed for First Friday Art Walk artists (and by successful artists) that will present topics significant to build their marketing skill set.The workshops will be designed in collaboration with Sarah Marie Hawkins, founder of Menagerie, a local non-profit specializing in art promotion. Ms. Hawkins has coached numerous emerging artists with strategies to build a customer base and has organized pop-up art galleries to help market their art. The ""Thriving in the Creative Economy"" project will be managed by LifeSTEPS' Director of Social Services at WAL, and faciliated by Ms. Hawkins.

","LifeSTEPS' Thriving in Sacramento's Creative Economy project has the economic potential to have many layers of impact on the local economy and in particular the R street Corridor. First Friday Art Walk artists will aquire skills that will grow their customer base, resulting in increased art sales. Their personal income gains increase their purchasing power which is often spent close to home in neighborhood cafes. More significantly, an increase in income creates housing  stability for both individuals and families. When more citizens are secure economically it benefits all of Sacramento's neighborhoods, businesses and puts less strain on City services.  ","The majority of career artists are working long hours for little economic reward. Artistic communities are typically groups of people who struggle to find affordable housing, experience food insecurity and are often unable to care for basic needs like health care. Providing opportunities for artistic communities to learn skills to help move them toward self-sustainable career paths will alleviate a host of inequities that definitely have social consequences.

After school sessions will include drawing, painting, writing, public presentations, and community engagement workshops.The project will impact both participants and the community where they live. Mural-making is a long practiced Mexican tradition in which murals that adorned public places were carried social and political messages. In the U.S., the Chicano movement adopted early muralists' strategy of making public art as a way of working for social justice.

In 2017 we introduced comedy and featured 10 local comedians. First Fest is a multi-stage, multi-day music festival with an all local lineup-- right down to the beer selection. While FF has always been a ticketed event, we have been working toward a goal of making FF free for all community members to attend. We have always focused on making FF accessible to community members regardless of socio-economic background. We emphasize an inclusive environment that focuses on cultural diversity through arts and music by showcasing the diverse local talent found within our region.First Fest is a place for collaboration and a springboard into more opportunities after the festival. It is a family-friendly atmosphere that crosses genre boundaries, bringing artists and musicians of varying age ranges, career lengths, and expertise together for a multi-day event while forging lasting relationships that affect the local arts scene by perpetuating a more creative, mixed-genre style of performance and show curation.First Fest creates a platform for underrepresented artists to showcase their work on a large scale in a way that many have never and may never get a chance to do. Moreover, it exposes the community to what can be found within its walls. It encourages guests to take their experience at First Fest and use it as fuel to participate in the local arts scene around the communityto show up to events, to purchase tickets, to buy merchand most of all, to look for arts to support inside of their city at the local level.

We are also working to pre-fund the festival in order to make it free for all community members to attend. Ultimately, this will allow for the more community members to attend and to spend their money within the festival with our vendors and artists. ","FF spends approx. $45,000 with local vendors for rentals, supplies, artist payments and beer over the 6 month planning period. During the event, approx. $60,000 changes hands via food, beer, merch, and vendor sales.  Overall, FF generates over $100,000 in spending within the city. With a larger reach and increased attendance, this number increases exponentially. Grant funding to pre-fund the festival and allow for free admission would easily double the economic impact of the project immediately. ","We select musicians and artists from diverse backgrounds with deliberate intent. We also always include under-age musicians who are typically underrepresented in the scene because they are unable to play most venues due to age restrictions. The art, comedy, and music lineup is intended to celebrate a unification of art across cultures while placing emphasis on becoming an art-focused community that empowers a just, inclusive, and culturally equitable city.

The Pop-Up Adventure Play Day offers fun & games for the whole community. Come over & play! Go home energized, inspired & dirty.","Free play is a catalyst for community building, place-making, healthy human development, and literacy acquisition; as such, it drives economic development. That is why we are proposing to produce and promote seven Pop-Up Adventure Play days on the grounds of neighborhood libraries between November 2017 and October 2018.The Pop-Up Adventure Play Days are free, public celebrations of play, stocked with loose parts (such as cardboard boxes, fabric, tape and string) and staffed by play workers. Materials and tools  from wood, hammers and saws to household items, paints and brushes  are on hand so kids and adults alike can bring their ideas to life. With a little imagination, cardboard boxes and duct tape become forts, helicopters and furniture. With some creative engineering, empty cans, old tires, and used keyboards transform into sculptures or machines. Not only are the individual participants creating their own designs and art, they are creating a sense of place and community.The Pop-Up Play Days will take place on the grounds of Colonial Heights, Cooledge, Del Paso Heights, King, McKinley, North Natomas, and South Natomas libraries. We are proud to collaborate with these Libraries as they are highly accessible, have the required outdoor space available, and recognize the importance of play to healthy human development and healthy community development. It is also possible to hold the Pop-Up Adventure Play Days in neighborhood streets, vacant lots or uninhabited buildings if preferred.Popular in other parts of the world, Adventure Play in community settings is rare in the U.S. This unique type of play is brought to Sacramento by Fairytale Town. A nonprofit organization, Fairytale Town has a long history of bringing creative play-based public programs to our community. Most recently, Fairytale Town used Pop-Up Adventure Play Days to build momentum to establish the Sacramento Adventure Playground at Maple Neighborhood Center. We see that these Pop-Up programs are highly replicable and can be used to create shared experiences which energize neighborhoods and build a sense of community.We would love to have the chance to work, and play, with you to bring this innovative community project to life. We believe that through play, we can inspire greater social connections, encourage economic activity, and strengthen our community.",11/1/17,10/31/18,"We will measure the success of the Pop-Up Play Days by the number of people who attend, the number of collaborators and volunteers we involve, the feedback we receive from all who participate, and how much traditional and social media engagement we receive. The ultimate measure of success will be whether the Pop-Up Adventure Play Days inspire others to replicate similar activities in their own streets and neighborhoods. ","All funds received for the project will be used locally to hire personnel, purchase or rent supplies and equipment, and promote the program to the community. Food vendors will be on site to provide refreshments  needed fuel for active play. In addition, we will recruit and train youth volunteers to help us implement the project. In these ways, the Play Days encourage economic activity in the neighborhoods we serve. As important, Adventure Play Days at libraries will link the importance of play to the development of literacy skills, a critical component for economic growth in individuals and communities alike.","The need to play is innate. Play promotes physical activity, allows us to burn off steam, increases creativity and collaboration, and gives us opportunities for social interaction  activities that are critical to an individuals physical, mental, and emotional health, and a communitys social and economic health. Despite abundant evidence regarding the importance of play, the space, time and resources for play have diminished in recent years. Thats why projects like the Pop-Up Adventure Play Days are important initiatives for community-building and place-making. Families and communities that play together are stronger, healthier and more vibrant than those who dont. "

With a series of lectures, including the Anthropology of D??a de los Muertos, workshops, such as sugar skull making with local artists, and business altars connecting the community with local businesses, the month-long celebration builds cultural awareness and addresses cultural equity, providing a space for the largely unspoken-for Latino community to engage with their Oak Park neighbors. The November 2nd culminating experience is a cultural celebration of D??a de los Muertos, which incorporates traditional musicians, dancers, community and personal altars, as well as pop-up hub of local artists, artisans, and food vendors activating an often-unused public space in a celebration that adheres to Mexican traditions remembering deceased family and friends, and also provides a celebration of life for the living.The project is multi-pronged in its impact, empowering the 38% Latino population of Oak Park, providing opportunities for those in underserved communities to experience and engage in public art and benefit from local culture and economy. Incorporating over 140 student volunteers, the project not only educates and engages youth, it also provides the opportunity for service learning and civic engagement.D??a de los Muertos Oak Park is unique in that it is organized and run by an all-volunteer community group. The project employs a network of partners and sponsors that include the Office of Councilmember Jay Schenirer, County Supervisor Phil Serna, Oak Park Business Association, the California Endowment, the Monterey Trail Business District, the Stockton Boulevard Partnership, La Familia Counseling Center, SMUD, Sacramento Republic FC, Crocker Art Museum, the Sacramento Public Library, Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services, Oak Park Neighborhood Association, Wellspring Women's Center, local businesses, non-profits, and faith-based organizations, among others.Utilizing an effective marketing and communication campaign that incorporates social media, radio, television, and print media, the project targets Sacramento's underserved populations and all those in the Greater Sacramento area, highlighting Oak Park as a destination for arts and culture in the region.In our first year, D??a de los Muertos Oak Park had a dramatic impact.

Economic benefits include bridging the business corridor and surrounding community to promote increased foot traffic; reinvigorating public spaces; promoting cross-pollination between artists, community, and businesses; and inviting those outside of Oak Park to become familiar with Oak Park's breadth of amenities. This project incorporates established brick-and-mortar businesses, artists and artisans, food vendors, and small business ventures. Our project considers that a community's health is dependent on the interactions between its residents, visitors, and its businesses.","Oak Park has a Latino demographic of 38% that is largely unspoken for in a community that is already underserved.

CalFresh (also known as food stamps) usage at farmers markets is currently underutilized, with limited outreach as a main barrier. Our plan is to hire a local artist to create a large sign/public art piece informing recipients of CalFresh benefits that they can use these benefits at their local farmers market.We have created a Call for Artists (see ""Supplemental Information"" #1). If funded, the selected artist will receive a $2,200 commission and the sign will be located next to the existing Oak Park Farmers Market sign at 33rd St. and 12th Ave, a high-visibility location on City of Sacramento-owned land. It is worth noting that while this sign will be placed next to another sign which promotes the Oak Park Farmers Market, our messaging is applicable to all local farmers markets in Council District 5 and beyond. The sign infrastructure will not be permanent, so a building permit will not be required.The partners are leaning on the expertise and networks of Valley Vision, who developed the Call for Artists (CFA) for this project, to disseminate the CFA far and wide. Valley Vision has successfully executed two prior CFA processes - for the 80-foot mural on the side of its building and for the Region Rising conference in 2015 - both of which can be viewed in ""Supplemental Information"" #2 and #3.This project is a fusion of public art and food access with the goal of lifting up a disadvantaged community in South Sacramento. We hope to build more art signs in communities across the City of Sacramento and elsewhere in the County using this scalable model, if additional funding can be secured. We see this project as the tangible start of a larger City and County-wide effort that empowers communities to address food access issues through Creative Economy Pilot focus areas like public art, farm-to-fork, communications, cultural equity, underserved communities, and more in an innovative and collaborative manner. This project exemplifies a genuinely creative Farm-to-Fork Capital that doesn't leave anyone behind.",9/15/17,,"Success will be measured by increased use of CalFresh benefits at local farmers markets, increased inquiries regarding this use, and at least 3 media spotlights (in print, online, or by way of video/radio) regarding this sign and its impact on the community.The Oak Park Farmers Market, being the closest local farmers market to the sign, will track both CalFresh users who sign up to use their benefits at the market as well as how much money those users spend. A 20% increase in CalFresh use at this market is a goal.","Our mission is to increase the number of CalFresh recipients using their benefits at local farmers markets, which generates $1.79 in economic activity for every dollar spent (USDA). The three zip codes in close proximity to the sign location (95817, 95820, and 95822) have a large number of CalFresh beneficiaries - totaling 16,787 people who could be using their benefits to purchase healthy foods at their local market. Just 1,000 additional farmers market visits by CalFresh users could translate to over $10,000 in additional revenue to farmers market vendors (including farmers, restaurateurs, and pop-up businesses) over one season alone.","This project brings critical information to the disadvantaged South/Central Oak Park area in the form of public art. A direct result of more equitable access to information regarding this particular use of CalFresh benefits is increased access to the healthy, locally-sourced foods found at the farmers market.Improved health outcomes, social capital, healthy food consumption, and other indicators of community vibrancy are longer-term social impacts that directly address the underserved communities, youth, and cultural equity considerations in this community (which is located in both The California Endowment's 'Building Healthy Communities' area and the federally-designated Sacramento Promise Zone)."

Sections of a special etched polycarbonate which are carefully heat sculpted, are then added for depth. This pearlescent translucent material is then backed with a series of "" Smart LEDs"", light modules that are individually programmable. Dynamic sequences are customized to create engaging patterns that move. Going a step further is where this piece brightly reflects the aim of our City's Creative Economy project.  By placing a motion sensor within the sculpture, it allows people to walk by and interact with the mural, changing patterns and even creating  specific images of lights, a flower that blooms, a radiating heart or smiling emoticon, for instance.The first two main locations in mind are: 1) Arden Fair Mall, as it has the space and caters to a diverse crowd. This also inspires other events and projects to make use of this pieces's unique feature while it is installed there. I have reached out to the property managers 2) I have been talking with a local theater company that is near the Shriner's hospital for children, about the possibility of installing this there for a specific duration.

Our productions focus on minimalism and simplicity to maintain an emphasis on language and traditional storytelling methods. We strive to create work that is accessible and relevant to modern audiences and to explore new ways to invigorate the public interest in a theatre for all people. In producing White Guy on the Bus we build a greater understanding of the beneficial value of theatre and art within our community.The company was founded in New York in 2009 with the idea to produce shows that were portable and could pop up in non-traditional locations. In 2014, the organization moved to Sacramentos Oak Park neighborhood with hopes of establishing a performing arts scene. Currently, Oak Park does not have a resident theatre company. Our goal is to partner with existing organizations and utilize untapped local resources to bring live theatre to the area.After the success of our inaugural production in Oak Park, Cock by Mike Bartlett; a play which deals with gender and sexuality - we are eager to produce our next socially relevant show. Our production of White Guy on the Bus would explore issues currently facing our community. White Guy on the Bus tells the story of a wealthy white businessman who befriends a single black mother on the local commuter bus. As they get to know one another, they form a new friendship, but as their pasts unfold, tensions rise, which ignites a disturbing and crucial exploration of race.As ITL is dedicated to creating work in non-traditional spaces we will collaborate with local theatre actors and designers to create and build the set, lights, sound, and costumes. Every show we produce is built from the ground up. For instance, we will transform the Brickhouse Gallery & Art Complex into a performance art venue.  We first design and build an audience structure defining the space and informing the overall concept of the production.  The lighting designer adds color and defines the architecture of the space.  The costume designer helps bring the characters from the page to the stage. The set designer creates the world in which the play takes place.  The collaborative nature of this endeavor creates and artistic community that expands beyond the gallery walls and invites the community to participate in the event.",10/1/17,1/31/18,"We will measure this productions success by its social and economic impact on Oak Park. Through our production choices, we aim to cultivate an open and diverse audience, and in particular, to engage a younger demographic. Large ticket sales would reflect that accomplishment. A successful production will generate engagement with ITL on social networking sites and a broader following. We aim to deepen our relationship with community members, and serve as an economic catalyst for local businesses. This production will be a stepping-stone to the creation of Oak Parks first permanent theatre company. ","Art is an essential part of a citys identity. ITLs successful creative place-making builds the economy at the local level, enhances surrounding non-arts businesses and provides job opportunities. We are partnering with the Brickhouse Gallery & Art Complex, and will provide them with a portion of the box office sales. More importantly we will bring in a new, vibrant audience, which in turn means more potential interest in the local restaurants, nightlife, and retail. Additionally we will provide local artists with paying jobs, establishing a non-profit theatre that values the work of their collaborators. ","ITLs production and creative teams are a diverse group of collaborators who share a common belief in theatre as a means for social change. We want to ignite a passion for theatre in young people and underserved communities; as the Sacramento theatre scene is primarily frequented by older white patrons. Our productions will encourage dialogue on social issues, increase civic pride, engage diverse neighborhood residents, and strengthen Oak Parks cultural and economic viability.

After the lesson, DJs play a variety of Latin music genres throughout the night, including Brazilian funk which is danced as a group in a ""follow the leader"" manner. People in attendance vary from dancers of all levels, people who have always wanted to learn, groups of friends looking for fun night out, and even people just wanting to listen to music and people-watch. This family friendly environment is fun and welcoming, and attracts an ever-growing number of people out to every event. In addition to the number of people who already know of the event, the music also attracts wanderers exploring the area.Bachata on da Edge was founded in 2016 by a few local dancers that found the beauty of the city of Sacramento while walking around and began dancing to music playing through their phones. It gave them an idea to actually host a more formal event in the city with better sound equipment and a bigger crowd. The event is easily set up in different locations because the following that has been established continues to grow after every event. This year we have participated in Sunday Street on Broadway, hosted a. successful event in downtown, and another in Old Sacramento.",7/15/17,,"The project can be deemed successful if we meet the goal of participants in attendance for the particular event, including attendance by community members. At the last event held in Old Sacramento we reached approximately 800 people in attendance. More importantly, it is successful if the location that we decide on benefits from the participants exploring the area and purchasing from the vendors. ","The project has an opportunity to have a significant economic impact in a location. During the last two events, both locations have generated extra revenue by selling food and/or drinks to participants. Old Sacramento restaurants benefitted from our 800 plus participants who purchased from local businesses throughout the event. If it is assumed that the average spend is $5, then $4,000 is a target one can expect. Furthermore, the event has much growth potential. ","The proposed project incorporates cultural equity and awareness by highlighting  art and food from throughout Latin America with works from local artists in addition to the music and dance.   By exposing attendees to Latin music and culture, they can grow an appreciation and understand of the differences among the Latino community and exposing young Latinos to their culture. It is a fun event for all ages with many new things people can learn."

The aim of the District 2 Arts Expos is to bring art engagement activities to the North Sacramento/Del Paso Heights community, a neighborhood where access to quality arts programming is severely lacking. Not only will District 2 Arts Expos showcase the variety and vibrancy of the arts, they will also be an opportunity to bring the community together in a positive way.The North Sacramento Community Coalition will host the District 2 Arts Expos at Grant Union High School in the late fall of 2017 and at Robertson Community Center in the spring of 2018.

It extends from 34th to 35th along V Street. The V-Street Garden began as a small project to enhance the Jr. High student entrance to the Sac High Campus and to the neighborhood. It has evolved into a highly desirable aspect of an area identified as a disadvantaged community by the State of California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.Approximately 150 people experience the garden daily. Students, residents and visitors have stopped to share appreciation for the positive feelings of happiness and community pride they receive from it.The V-Street Gardens is supported by Sac High and all neighboring residents. In addition to student support, Sac High has contributed to the garden by providing over 250 feet of garden hose. The hose has been divided and is staged at several residents spigots. Hoses are extended to the garden daily for hand irrigation. Anne Fenkner is the primary caretaker of the garden. She is a UC Master Gardener and serves as the neighborhood liaison to the school. A neighborhood artist has enhanced the garden with a post mosaic; 7 neighbors contribute by providing irrigation access.Current challenges to garden sustanabiltiy include inadequate tools, irrigation sourcing, poor soil and the cost to purchase plants and seeds. All of the hoses now have multiple leaks and spray water into the street during use.   Many plants struggle to thrive in soil meant for track use. The soil is porous and lacks nutrients -based material.This funding will support the purchase of replacement hoses, plants and seed. Drip hoses will add to water effeciency. Soil amendments and water barriers will enhance the growing conditions and the ability for the soil to accept and uptake water and nutrients. Signage will be created to encourage respectful behavior and reduce the likelihood of vanalism. A local artist is willing to work with students to enhance the garden by crafting two original pieces of art. Funding will also support two community celebrations of lite fare and beverages. The social gatherings will take place in the spring and fall. They will take place either on residential front yards or along the garden on the school side. The events will be advertised within the garden and on the V-Street Garden Facebook page.  Everyone connected to the planting; care and enjoyment of the V-Street Garden will be encouraged to attend.",9/15/17,,"Success will be demonstrated with a year round display of flowers and art.  Garden sustainability will be achieved with soil amendments, seasonal plantings and timely irrigation. Students, their parents, Sac High administrators, teachers and neighbors will be invited to participate in bi-annual social gathering to meet and connect with one another.  We anticipate over 50 people attending each event. Garden and related art will experience minimum vandalism due to increased awareness, community pride and participation. Ideally the V-Street Garden will be used as a model for other Sacramento area neighborhoods and schools seeking neighborhood cohesion, increased desirability and pride. ","The V-Garden will enhance community attractiveness, connectivity and contribute to the desirability of living in and investing in the area. Adding art will support and validate local artists. Research shows when students feel a connection and pride in their school, they do better academically and are more likely to contribute to the community. This is can result in higher academic achievement, college and trade school admissions and greater neighborhood stability. Residents who are more attached to their community create higher levels of social cohesion and social control, express less fear of crime, and contribute to the vitality of the neighborhood. ","V-Street Garden is within a disadvantaged area. 70% of Sac High students qualify for free or reduced cost lunch. The stress of poverty can cause physiological responses, which are expressed as increased risk of various diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, etc. Scientific literature indicates urban green spaces such as the V-street Garden have profound, positive impacts for individuals and communities. In studies of lower income households, the greenness of a young persons environment positively impacts cognitive functioning, ability to concentrate, and self-discipline. Such positive  perceptions will likely extend to residents and visitors to the neighborhood as well. "

Williams to create a massive mural across from Roosevelt Park.,"The 10th Street Commercial buildings are located in the center of Sacramentos 95814 Zip Code Area Promise Zone, which means it has been designated as a vulnerable high poverty community.  CADA could simply paint its commercial properties to bring them up-to-date, but we wanted to do more.  We wanted to create something extraordinary that would inspire the surrounding residents and enliven the commercial businesses.The 10th Street Commercial Mural project will be a collaboration of local artists Jose Di Gregorio, Stephen V. Williams as art directed by 94-year-old Sacramento art legend Gregory Kondos and Karen Ulep, CADA Communications Manager.  This winning collaboration will produce an exciting and unique work of art that appeals to the urban and lively culture of Downtown Sacramento and enlivens the commercial businesses adjacent to Roosevelt Park.The mural along the exterior of the 10th Street commercial buildings will be one unifying art piece.  Co-created by popular Sacramento muralists Jose Di Gregario and Stephen V. Williams, this is the first public project they have collaborated on together.  This approach will connect the storefronts Yummy Choice, OB2000, Bagel Time, Goodyear Cobbler & Cleaners as well as the entrance to Somerset Parkside Condominiums resulting in a cohesive mural that is approximately 4,000 square feet in size.  We believe this project will transform the neighborhood and serve as a catalyst for private development improvements and increased patronage to the 10th Street businesses.  We hope surrounding residents will view the mural as an extension of their living room and become a place for social gathering. If awarded this grant, CADA will be able to direct more funding toward Roosevelt Park improvements, which will directly impact the local residents and business owners.CADA had the idea to have one of the world's most prominent California landscape artists, 94-year-old Gregory Kondos, assist in the art direction for the 10th Street Commercial mural in order to create media buzz, to help Sacramento's immediately embrace the final mural as it ties into Sacramentos rich artistic history and its vibrant emerging art scene, and to add to the legacy portfolio of Gregory Kondos in the neighborhood that he so generously supports and lives in.",9/15/17,10/1/17,"The beautiful collaborative original painting will help create a vibrant & inspiring common space that the entire community can enjoy.  It will also be evident as CADA will be able to measure the increased sales & traffic of its commercial tenants.  Media coverage & comments on social media sites like Nextdoor will also indicate success.  CADAs recent collaboration with the City of Sacramento, Truitt Bark Park, utilized Stephen V. Williams for the BARK art sculpture mural and McKinley Park had Jose Di Gregorio paint its playground; both projects have received wide favorable media attention and comments on social media.","Obviously, increased patronage of the local and surrounding merchants.  However, the social impact will also be significant as it coincides with CADAs continued renovation of Roosevelt Park.  CADA's efforts should discourage vandalism & other criminal activity as there will be more activity and eyes on the park and commercial businesses.  This in turn, should invite increased private development interest in the area and well as encourage current residents and other area businesses to invest in their properties and take a more active role in their community.","This project is located in an underserved community and is located directly across from a park.  As such, CADA believes this mural will inspire the entire community and invite social gathering and collaboration.  The current draft design speaks to all cultures."

The grant will also pay for the production of 3 workshops to engage the local community and the area's artists, students, farmers, food-makers and scientists, in envisioning a dynamic development.Inspired by Andy Warhols iconic New York art studio, The Factory, where creative people gathered to make art, The Food Factory will be a hub where culinary artists, food makers and emerging food entrepreneurs can come together to create a food district in the center of one of the USA's most vibrant agricultural regions - Yolo and Sacramento counties.  The project is being developed in partnership with the Sacramento Regional Community Foundation, the University of California, Davis, Food and Agriculture Department, and Valley Vision.  It will be a place for the production of healthy food and the creation and growth of viable food businesses in a clean, efficient, and sustainable environment built for both start- ups and developing local entrepreneurs. In addition to immense research, production and storage space, the Food Factory will include indoor/outdoor event spaces, a retail shop, and a place for public gatherings including pop-up dinners, festivals, films, markets, exhibitions, and a library.The Food Factory has very few characteristics of a typical factory, rather imagine instead a lively, neighborhood anchor, where local food-makers like David Bui, a stay-at-home dad who makes rustic sourdough bread from his kitchen and Janet McDonald, who makes tomato jam and Meyer lemon marmalade, gather each day to share resources, and have access to a crew to label, pack, and distribute their products. A new kitchen will be designed to test small batches of everything from pickles to pasta. Families will stop to taste new foods or enjoy a coffee on their way to the bike trail. This will all be made possible by designers who will integrate professional uses with inviting, relaxing spaces for the public, and landscaping and art to create a welcoming outdoor area that engages the neighborhood and encourages smart growth.A strong conceptual design illustrating the above is critical at this point in the development of the project to help the partners secure funding to redevelop the building.",10/1/17,5/1/18,The project's success will be determined by the successful completion of  architectural drawings for the Food Factory which ultimately results in securing $5 million dollars in funding to redevelop the space.  ,"Once completed, the Food Factory will be a place for creative food makers and entrepreneurs to launch businesses and workforce training with a local, regional, and possibly national reach. The Food Factory will enhance the City's reputation as a leading player in the agricultural and small food landscape, attracting new business and establishing a solid economic base. Graduates from local food programs will move their businesses to Sacramento, helping to avoid the talent drain and keeping artists and artisans local. It will support activities, including food and cultural festivals, performances, demonstrations, shopping, and classes, bringing people to an underutilized neighborhood.","Yes, it will change an entire neighborhood while serving youth, women and minorities.  Located in the oldest neighborhood in Sacramento, a few blocks  the American River and American River Parkway on the north edge of town, the Factory will transform an economically and culturally diverse neighborhood. It will tie the underutilized riverfront and adjacent parkway to the neighborhood that is both safe and inviting. It will be a neighborhood point of pride, a beautiful space for visitors of all ages. It will encourage new amenities, creating a stronger sense of connection between Alkali Flats, downtown, midtown, and the rail yards."

Using interlocking flooring and pressure sensors G.R.O.U.N.D collects data created by the interaction of dancers, performers and audience members which in turn effects a 3D world where online users can see and interact with these changes. In response, the actions of the online community will be represented visually and audibly to the live audience.What is G.R.O.U.N.D?G.R.O.U.N.D is broken down into two parts the physical installation and the virtual representation.The Physical.The physical installation consists of a modular floor panel made of a foam base with a interchangeable acrylic top. Embedded in the foam portions will be pressure sensors, a low voltage power supply, micro controller unit, and LEDs. Ideally each panel can have its own wireless connection with additional wired solution for power and communication, this will provide redundancy and a simple method to reprogram the panels if desired. The sensors will provide the input to the micro controller changing the color of the embedded LEDs. The audience and performers can move around the floor changing the color of the panels. Additionally each panel can be used as a portable Wifi hub.The Virtual.The collected data is then interpreted into a 3D virtual environment, each panel will represent a parcel of virtual land. Actions on each panel cause a change to the corresponding parcel of virtual land. Online viewers using a personal computer or a mobile device can watch as forests turn to grasslands or deserts to oceans, all depending on the actions of the live performers. Online users can also interact with the virtual world having a direct effect on the panels. By doing simple tasks online, users can interact with the flooring to change the color of the panel thus participating  with the performers and the audience.Goal of the project.To provide a meaningful interactive experience for the audience to relate to and explore. By creating this unique space I hope to inspire thought and conversation about the link between our intentional actions and the often unknown consequences of those actions. Provide a novel approach to social wifi hot spots giving temporary internet access in locations where G.R.O.U.N.D is set up. To give the community a method to expand performing arts opportunities to under used and often forgotten spaces, such as concrete amphitheaters and parks found throughout our region. ",9/15/17,,"Success of the project would be if various arts and education groups used G.R.O.U.N.D. as a fun and innovative approach to combine performance art with technology as well as to provide a wifi hotspot for community events. This project is unique in many aspects due to the tactile nature of the device. Having an art/technology installation that requires physical interaction is rare and commonly overlooked. Often technology seems removed from us, an after thought. Being required to physically interact with this device brings another dimension to understanding. This understanding is essential to learning new and complex ideas. ","The portability of G.R.O.U.N.D. means that it can provide an economic benefit wherever it goes. It can be used for performances, classes and community events which in turn stimulates a micro-economy for that neighborhood. I envision G.R.O.U.N.D. as a catalyst for pop up events, festivals and social gatherings drawing in food trucks, craft booths, vendors and more. Furthermore this portable flooring system allows performing arts groups to utilize unusual spaces for shows or classes without having to worry about theater or studio rental fees. Instead they can focus their limited resources on paying their artists.","The creation of G.R.O.U.N.D is just a start. Being an open use modular device it is designed to be expanded and innovated upon. Workshops and training classes can be created for the community, giving opportunities for anyone, especially our youth and underserved, to learn and build in a fun and exciting way. Additionally, G.R.O.U.N.D. provides performing arts groups a portable flooring system to be able to take their performances anywhere and make their art accessible to any community."

The audience will not know what the inciting event was but it will be understood as a contemporary phenomenon which brings people together often first through social media. The play will be both funny and serious, also quite modern in its presentation. The audience will see text messages and emails presented as super titles and video projections will be a significant element in the production design. The characters are a broad multi-racial, multi-generational cross section: a young pregnant woman who has the idea for the Candlelight Vigil and her skeptical but supportive husband; two journalists assigned to cover the event - one very excited about it, the other very hesitant; two members of the police force who will be there for security - also with mixed emotions and expectations; an older veteran of the Civil Rights Movement and a young political neophyte. We will use an adaptation of the acclaimed Cornerstone Theater process of creating community engaged theater. The playwrights will become aware of the community through research, visits, interviews, story circles, and other activities. The play will be written based on what is learned and what is artistically relevant and inspiring. A draft of the script will be read with members of the community we've encountered along the way with feedback and discussion.

Up to twenty middle-schoolers will attend a 6 day afternoon/evening camp. Using age appropriate materials they will learn how to create a collaborative digital art piece.  Four days of the workshop will consist of small lesson projects to introduce students to JavaScript, Arduino, LEDs and resistors in a highly interactive and hands-on learning environment. The last two days will utilize their new skills to program an LED light strip and coordinate their individually programmed LED light strips into a collaborative art piece.  The piece will be installed for a ""gallery"" display and culminating evening reception at the Pannell Center.Urban Tech.The process of writing  and using code to control electronic elements is a fundamental basis of understanding the interaction between human designers and electronic devices.The culminating digital art piece will be interactive.  In the darkened area of the exhibition space, the LED lights casts varying shadows depending upon the objects present.  The real-time addition and/or subtraction of inanimate objects and humans amidst the exhibit create an artistically correlative experience with technology.Youth are the artists and makers. This project empowers and educates youth to develop real-word coding, electronics and problem solving skills applicable to collaborate to create the digital art piece. These skills are taught in a self-learning mode, which encourages them to learn by trial and error and think logically and creatively in order to problem solve.One high school student will gain valuable work experience as a teacher's assistant, and be empowered and trained to possibly conduct his/her own workshop using the same curriculum and materials.

With a mission to provide training and performance opportunities in the areas of drama, dance, and music, making these arts accessible to community residents, CA is the premier African American performing arts organization in Sacramento, and only one of a few in California.  CA offers dance classes, singing lessons, and theater instruction through a very successful year-round performance series.  CA presents all of its training for free or on a pay what you can basis to ensure arts access, particularly for the African American community.  CAs resilience is largely due to the dedication of its founder, volunteers, and patronage that is unique in its cultural, ethnic, and economic diversity.The Creative Economy Pilot Project has presented itself at a very serendipitous time for CA.  In June, CA was given notice that it will have to vacate its 10-year residence imminently, which has resulted in a major organizational crossroad.  Rather than looking at this situation with trepidation, CA has chosen to see it as an opportunity to expand its reach, much like it did when it moved from Oak Park to East Sacramento. While CA does the challenging work of moving, we are excited to propose a project we view as a game-changer for us and the City of SacramentoThe Street Corner Cabaret.Over the course of a year, CA will implement four Street Corner Cabarets at sites of significance to the African American community.  Drawing upon African American cultural roots, this project will embrace the arts as a mechanism to explore the history and culture of Sacramento broadly and the contributions of African-Americans specifically.  At these come one, come all micro-events, CA will invite participants to reclaim and reimagine, through their creative and imaginative souls, areas that have had significant trauma or been sites of historical triumphs.  Each event will have professional staging and audio production and feature local performing artists highly skilled in their craft, CA students, and local community participants.  The event staging will be set up like a cabaret and feature one to two food vendors/trucks with specials connected to a key theme and/or site.

The survey data will allow us to continually improve upon the Cabarets and compare and contrast initial versus final findings regarding possible awareness and impact.","We hope to have 150-250 attendees at each Cabaret, but we will be selecting sites that can definitely hold more if needed.  We believe the community history and healing aspects of the programming will draw attendees from in and outside of Sacramento, increasing the dollars spent at local sites and with local vendors.  We also see ourselves utilizing a number of local businesses to implement and promote the Cabarets, spreading grant dollars city-wide. Finally, long-term this project will allow CA to be a vital entity during a time of transition, helping to ensure Sacramento doesnt lose another vital cultural entity.","Celebration Arts began because African Americans in the Sacramento region had little access to existing performing arts programs in the community and in educational institutions.  And, if admitted those institutions, the performance offerings and opportunities were not prominent and most often restricted to historically demeaning roles.  For over, thirty years, CA has given and inspired pride within Sacramentos African American community, and it believes that there is power in sharing the stories and narratives of people of color.  The Street Corner Cabarets will take what CA has been doing throughout the City, connecting people, communities, and in-kind spirits through art. "

We provide affordable practice/studio space to local creatives and occasionally host highly-curated events that bring people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, economic backgrounds, and tastes together to experience new music, performance, food, and visual art for a reasonable entry price. We believe in the cultural value of providing exposure for emerging artists and we never want money to be a barrier between a good artist and a successful artist. We also want the public, no matter their demographic, to have access to this culture through our events. Currently, we face three limitations: a lack of funding, public event policy, and a typical building capacity of 50 people.We would like to escalate our community activations by producing a series of 18 events (1-2 per month) from September 2017 through September 2018 aiming at an audience of 75-200 attendees. With this grant, we will promote and expand our message, which is aligned with the Citys creative economy focus of empowering individual creators, making Sacramento a platform for experimentation, and engaging City Hall to innovate its policies. These events will feature an average of 3 local and touring talents (music, performance, new media, etc.), pop-up food by local chefs, visual artists work, event photography, and grant-related data collection.Additionally, we need support from the Citys agencies (Fire Dept., Entertainment, Zoning) to make 51-200 person events viable in our building, which Steve Hansens office has begun helping us with. In collaboration with the city, we want to explore new ways to rethink the event permitting system to make room for smaller, niche events in untraditional spaces that may not have the same budget or target audience as larger events. The city of Seattle recently published a guideline to policy that can help with this (see items 8, 14-16, and 22 at http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Arts/Downloads/Space/CULTURAL%20SPACE%20REPORT.pdf ).To supplement the citys investment, we are launching a crowd-funding campaign leading up to a fundraiser festival on August 26th with a goal of $7,500. We also collect rent from artist/musician members amounting to roughly $10,000 per year. We will also charge $8-10 per person for events to supplement artist stipends and expenses. On a final note, we are open to modifying our number of events if less grant money is available. ",9/15/17,9/15/18,"Success means that funding, policy change, thoughtful curation, marketing, and promotion allow us to consistently hit the 75-200 audience mark - proving that our message about the arts and the Citys desire to support creativity is being heard and appreciated by the community. Well keep data regarding attendance, amounts paid to performers/vendors, social media reach, and press coverage. Well also track the interest we receive in booking events because it gauges how far the message of Sacramento/The Red Museum is spreading around the world. This will culminate in a report that we will provide to the city in September 2018.","Nearly all of the funds spent on this project will go directly into the creative community through event talent stipends and rent supplementation for our warehouse, which gives artists/musicians studio space to continue to create. Additionally, each event will bring 75-200 people from the general public into Mansion Flats for the evening, where they will likely support local businesses (dinner, drinks, corner stores) and add activation to a neighborhood that suffers from high vagrancy and a lack of arts destinations or night life.","Our events are typically open to all ages and types of people and we specifically embrace programming by marginalized creators (economically challenged artists, LGBT, minority, avant-garde performance, and people under 21). These artists need places to perform and when given that opportunity, the audience reflects the diversity. See our past work sample for representation of our diverse events. Additionally, our neighborhood of Mansion Flats lacks night time activation and has high vagrancy. By adding more evening activation, we believe the neighborhood will be safer and more appealing - although this is difficult to prove through data collection."

Once ecologically established, Kaleidoscope will join Santa Cruz's Natural Bridges State Park and Pacific Grove's Monarch Grove Sanctuary as a premier wildlife and eco-tourist destination. Moreover, with the countrys largest urban tree canopy, Sacramento has the potential to become the first city-wide butterfly sanctuary in the world.Currently, Sacramento's Swallowtail butterfly numbers are meager in urban areas where they lack food, shelter and safe passage. Kaleidoscope ultimately aims to recreate the more vital butterfly habitat of Sacramento's waterways with butterfly sanctuary sculpture gardens throughout Sacramento and its underserved communities. The initial riverfront Kaleidoscope creates the necessary butterfly corridor into the city for successful long-term expansion.While there are several great locations for the initial Kaleidoscope, the intersection of Sacramento River Intake Facility, Matsui Waterfront Park, and the forthcoming PowerHouseScienceCenter (PHSC) is the most civically compelling. Kaleidoscope aims to unify these different landscapes. In doing so it will create a more ecologically valuable and cohesive riverfront parkway experience that better connects OldTown, Discovery Park and future Railyards projects. As butterflies gain access to the city at its source of freshwater and Science Center, Sacramentans and tourists gain access to these monuments to innovation and an up-close kaleidoscopic view of the monumental phenomena of metamorphosis.Currently in scarce supply, the native CA Pipevine is the only plant on which the Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly can lay its eggs and hatched caterpillars can feed. A single CA Pipevine can grow to cover a large area but is very vulnerable as a young plant. They require weekly deep watering and 1-2 years to get established enough to be drought tolerant & support a large caterpillar population. By pairing young sensitive plants with protective trellis-sculptures, equipped with night-lighting and irrigation, we can ensure their successful maturation while providing artistic placeholders for site visitors until fully established and populated. This timeframe also coincides with PHSCs opening. Its first visitors will be greeted by lush native greenery teeming with caterpillars/cocoons/butterflies.Sculptures will be installed by local artists/gardeners Dan Tran & Trent Dean.

There will also be a Graffiti Art project that will consist of making graffiti style hats with acrylic paint and paint markers. This will take place during one of the Graffiti Art sessions.",9/22/17,12/15/17,"Succes will be measured by data provided from interviews with students and Mustard Seed staff, as well the completion of the various art projects by the students.","The students will be have opportunities to connect with local artists who will share how they earn full-time or part-time income through teaching, performing, and sharing their art. These interactions will provide examples to the students as to how they can use their artistic talents to pursue a career in the arts.The Cypher artists will be paid for the sessions they teach, and they will also have the opportunity to connect with the Mustard Seed School administration and teachers about future collaborations.","Hip Hop Culture comes from youth who lived in underserved communities that struggled with issues of gang violence, mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness. The youth at the Mustard Seed School have faced many of these same struggles. Connecting the stories of the growth of Hip Hop Culture and the struggles it's pioneers overcame to the struggles the Mustard Seed students currently face, provides creative and powerful opportunities for The Cypher to have a social impact on the lives of the students."
kaleidoscope-2,442,Trent Dean,Microgrant ($5k),Individual/Sole Proprietor,,Kaleidoscope (2 of 2),"Public Art/Installations, Youth/Education, Urban Tech, Underserved Communities, Cultural Equity","$4,990.00 ","$9,987.00 ",Kaleidoscope is a Butterfly sanctuary on & sculpture garden at the future @PowerHouseScienceCenter site.,"Kaleidoscope (taken from the collective term for a group of butterflies) is an urban riverfront butterfly sanctuary & sculpture garden. Once ecologically established, Kaleidoscope will join Santa Cruz's Natural Bridges State Park and Pacific Grove's Monarch Grove Sanctuary as a premier wildlife and eco-tourist destination. Moreover, with the countrys largest urban tree canopy, Sacramento has the potential to become the first city-wide butterfly sanctuary in the world.Currently, Sacramento's Swallowtail butterfly numbers are meager in urban areas where they lack food, shelter and safe passage. Kaleidoscope ultimately aims to recreate the more vital butterfly habitat of Sacramento's waterways with butterfly sanctuary sculpture gardens throughout Sacramento and its underserved communities. The initial riverfront Kaleidoscope creates the necessary butterfly corridor into the city for successful long-term expansion.While there are several great locations for the initial Kaleidoscope, the intersection of Sacramento River Intake Facility, Matsui Waterfront Park, and the forthcoming PowerHouseScienceCenter (PHSC) is the most civically compelling. Kaleidoscope aims to unify these different landscapes. In doing so it will create a more ecologically valuable and cohesive riverfront parkway experience that better connects OldTown, Discovery Park and future Railyards projects. As butterflies gain access to the city at its source of freshwater and Science Center, Sacramentans and tourists gain access to these monuments to innovation and an up-close kaleidoscopic view of the monumental phenomena of metamorphosis.Currently in scarce supply, the native CA Pipevine is the only plant on which the Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly can lay its eggs and hatched caterpillars can feed. A single CA Pipevine can grow to cover a large area but is very vulnerable as a young plant. They require weekly deep watering and 1-2 years to get established enough to be drought tolerant & support a large caterpillar population. By pairing young sensitive plants with protective trellis-sculptures, equipped with night-lighting and irrigation, we can ensure their successful maturation while providing artistic placeholders for site visitors until fully established and populated. This timeframe also coincides with PHSCs opening. Its first visitors will be greeted by lush native greenery teeming with caterpillars/cocoons/butterflies.Sculptures will be installed by local artists/gardeners Dan Tran & Trent Dean. They will source CA Pipevine and other CA native plants with guidance from the UC Davis Arboretum. Meanwhile, Tim Wong, California Academy of Sciences biologist & creator of @CaliforniaPipevineSwallowtail project will continue providing guidance and peer-review to the artists. ",9/15/17,,"Kaleidoscopes successes are incremental.-Generate social media engagement from art community interest over winter via night-lit sculptures visible from the River Parkway & I-5 freeway.-Generate interest & participation from environmental justice & scientific communities-Increase in presence of CA native plants and butterflies/caterpillars/cocoons onsite-Increase in # of site visitors & their duration of stay-Host successful onsite PHSC fundraising gala & re-ignite public interest in PHSC-Increase in issuance of Parks&Rec eventspace permits-Decrease in pollution & vandalism along the parkway-Receive statewide attention as part of @CaliforniaPipevineSwallowtail project ","Sacramento continually demonstrates to the world that as climate change accelerates, ecological literacy and resilience help ensure access to equitable & sustainable economic opportunities. This is also at the heart of PHSC's mission to engage people to explore the possibilities and responsibilities of science. Kaleidoscope also has the potential to turn Matsui Park into a desirable events destination, thusly increasing revenue to Parks & Rec through permit issuances.We further envision Micro-Kaleidoscope Kits as a top-seller in PHSCs future gift-shop. Visitors can take kits back to their schools and neighborhoods to create butterfly-sanctuaries of their own.","Kaleidoscope is meant to amplify and diversify PHSCs efforts and outreach toward youth and underserved communities. In the process, it creates a safer and more welcoming place along Riverfront Parkway for all people and wildlife.  Kaleidoscope is also meant to push the conversation on the multi-functionality of art and to encourage more systemic overlaps between art & science now when we need them most in the face of climate change. These cross-pollination attempts are meant to raise broader and more cohesive public awareness around ecosystem thinking, climate resilience and civic participation."
orchard-park-living-art-project,452,Lia Villados and Fiona Nies,Microgrant ($5k),Individual/Sole Proprietor,,Orchard Park Living Art Project,"Public Art/Installations, Performing Arts/Music, Temporary Activations, Youth/Education","$4,942.88 ","$6,000.00 ",A living art installation of ecologically-derived materials native to the area built along the bike path at Orchard and Barandas Parks.  ,"Community engagement. Ecologically sound and sourced artistic practices. Sacramento narratives and history explored. We are Lia Villados, visual artist, and Fiona Nies, performance artist. Lia has been a lead apprentice at Billick Rock Art since 2005, and Fiona is a classically trained actor/director with 13 years experience in performance. We intend to create a living art installation of ecologically derived materials native to the Sacramento Valley built along the bike path at Orchard and Barandas parks in Natomas which will also serve as the setting for a series of historical narrative performance pieces inspired by the literary works of California authors John Steinbeck, Jack London and Mark Twain. The goal of this project is to intertwine visual, site specific, narrative, and performance art with the intention of engaging the Sacramento/Natomas community, with a specific emphasis on area students, that will celebrate the unique ecological and artistic voice that is California.This project is an experiment in engaging students and community members alike. We aim to focus the objective of creative enlivenment of public space using a variety of artistic methods including earthworks, narrative, and interactive performance.  The build of the installations will begin in February 2018, allowing two months before our target performance dates of April 15-May 15. There will be four performances per week across four weeks on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings and one weekday matinee during school hours intended for local students to engage with art in a public space they are familiar and comfortable with, without the confines of a gallery or museum setting. The target area of this project is home to two schools; Two Rivers Elementary and the Leroy Greene Academy. We will reach out to administration and instructors to encourage student participation in experiencing the installation both during our matinee performances, and on their own time as they make use of their local park.  The content of the performance pieces in the installation space will align with California State history/literature objectives and allow students to engage with the material outside the classroom in an interactive and sensory manner.This project, part sculpture, part theatre and woven together thematically by the history and landscape of California, will provide a unique interactive experience that encourages students to think about the relationship between art,  environment, and their local community.",2/15/18,5/15/18,"This project will be a success if a statistically significant number of students from the two nearby schools are able to experience it. We will request that the schools encourage their students to visit the installation and notify families of scheduled performances. We plan to schedule several performances of the live show during school hours, and invite teachers to bring their classes. We will take headcounts of the number of students in attendance at each of these performances. Once the project is complete, teachers will hand out a simple survey to their students to gauge how effective it was.","The installation will double as the setting for twelve live, thematically-linked performances, which will take place over the course of four weeks on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings at 8:00. The timing of the shows will encourage our audience members to seek out local dining establishments for dinner beforehand, and drinks afterwards. Additionally, the permanent nature of the installation will attract people from other areas of Sacramento to South Natomas throughout the month, and encourage them to explore what else the area has to offer.","We will construct free, interactive, art that is accessible at all times of day within walking distance of both Two Rivers Elementary School and Leroy Greene Academy. This project will foster the artistic engagement of local youth by providing an opportunity to experience art at their own pace, within a comfortable and familiar context- the local park! We also plan to schedule four live performances over the course of the month during school hours in cooperation with the local schools' schedules, so that teachers can bring their classes. "
